# TODOs
## General
### Urgent stuff
> "Things that should be clarified really soon!"  

- [ ] Video recordings
	- [x] Inform lecturers and ask permission, also clarify the copyright restrictions on slides
	- [x] Check with A. Fischer (KIT) about technical details
	- [x] Check with Uwe about local requirements  
	- [x] Check with R. Kiese if we have a HiWi that would be interested in doing recordings
- [x] Mail lecturers about repository, planned schedule and timelines   
- [x] Initiate weekly meetings with K. Fuchs to push on and keep momentum 
- [ ] Student poster notification eMail (1/2 summary, 1/2 data used, required) 

### Resolve soon
> "These can take a bit longer (but not too long)..."  

- [ ] Setup GCP instance/ docker image for course (should be one image that is also deployed to GCP) 
- [ ] Schedule some dates to test-drive the notebooks with PhDs at IFU

## Admin tasks
> "Administrative stuff that needs fixing/ clarification."  

- [x] Wifi situation in lecture room (setup local access points and local network?)
- [ ] Saturday activities in addition to BYO data (some hiking suggestions, etc.)


## Datasets
> "Which datasets could we use for the notebooks?" 

Ideally, we'd want some IFU datasets that are relevant for a number of participants. Also, we should check with lecturers if they have pet datasets that make sense and fit their topics/ tools.
