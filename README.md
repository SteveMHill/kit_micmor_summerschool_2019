Notebooks and info for the **[MiCMOR](https://micmor.kit.edu) [SummerSchool "Environmental Data Science: From Data Exploration to Deep Learning"](https://micmor.kit.edu/sites/default/files/MICMoR%20Summer%20School%202019%20Flyer.pdf)**, IMK-IFU KIT Campus Alpin, Sept. 4 - 13 2019, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.  

This course covers the PyData stack and setting up a Data Science-centric development environment, good practices in reproducible science and the handling of common data formats. It then goes into Explorative Data Analysis techniques and effective visualisation, Machine Learning methods and finally applications of Deep Learning models for various Environmental Science tasks.

## Datasets
> "Which datasets could we use for the notebooks?" 

Ideally, we'd want some IFU datasets that are relevant for a number of participants. Also, we should check with lecturers if they have pet datasets that make sense and fit their topics/ tools.
